# rename-compress-bulk
This script can be used to change, the names of the files based on the folder name. If the files are images, they also can be compressed if you have an API key for tinyjpg

<h3> Once you've cloned the repo </h3>
Enter in your API key for Tinyjpg. You get it from their website. Then Enter the path for the directory that contains folders, which contains the images. The images will be renamed to the name of the directory they are contained in.

<br>
For example:
<code>Folder > Lenovo-Laptop > something.jpg</code>
will be renamed to:
<code>Folder > Lenovo Laptop > lenovo-laptop.jpg</code>
<br>
<br>
By default the spaces will be replaced by hyphens and the name will be converted to lower case. In future versions, I plan to make it more user friendly.
